NPRGHU: New Repository: Colors ~~

	How to use:
		In my previous repository, you can use the GetIndex() function to get the purpose of each function. There is only 
		one argument; where you insert the string value of a function's name: for example: print(GetIndex('PMV')), will 
		return the purpose of the PMV function. You are not required to use correct capitalization, although you are in
		PyMath. If there are any further issues, you can go to discussions.
	
	License:
		You may use this as much as you want, although please keep the credits. (Line 1)
